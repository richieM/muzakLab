# muzakLab
Machine-learning algorithmic music composition in Python

### Files

jingleMachine.py -- Utility used by scramblaudio, mainly overlayAudioWithSamples

muzakLab.py -- Right now, generates a random MIDI pattern and randomly overlays samples onto it, writes a .wav file

scramblaudio.py -- Takes in some audio, scramblaudios it, then uses jingleMachine to overlayAudioWithSamples, ad infinitum


Need to add:

scramble.py from scramble repo ipython notebook
